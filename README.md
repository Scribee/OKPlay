# OKPlay

Clone of the 2-4 player board game [__OK Play__](https://bigpotato.com/us/games/cinco-linko/) _(aka Cinco Linko in the US)_

## Rules

* Each player starts with 15 tiles of their color
* One player begins by placing a tile somewhere on the play area
* Players then take turns placing one of their tiles adjacent to other tiles
* The game ends when a player gets 5 of their tiles in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
* If all of the tiles are placed before anyone wins, instead players reposition one of their already placed tiles each turn
  * Note: Every tile on the board must always be connected to the others along a flat side, so a tile cannot be moved if it will leave others stranded

# OKPlay

Clone of the 2-4 player board game [__OK Play__](https://bigpotato.com/us/games/cinco-linko/)
_(Now called Cinco Linko in the US)_

## Rules

* Each player chooses a color and begins the game with 15 tiles
* One player begins by placing a tile somewhere on the play area
* Players take turns placing one of their tiles at a time adjacent to other tiles
* The game ends when a player gets 5 of their tiles in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
* If all the tiles are used up before anyone gets 5 in a row, each turn players instead reposition one of their already placed tiles
	* Note: Every tile on the board must always be connected to the others along a flat side, so a tile cannot be moved if it will leave others isolated
